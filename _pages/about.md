I am Ding Xiaoshan, currently serving as the head of Nanjing Huiyan Nengce Technology, dedicated to promoting innovation and application of intelligent technologies. I graduated from Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications with a bachelor's degree in Information Engineering and later obtained an MBA from the same institution. My career has focused on the information and communication sector, where I have held various positions including software development engineer at Huawei, IE design at Ericsson, and project management and pre-sales engineering at ZTE Communications. These experiences have allowed me to accumulate extensive knowledge in technical development and management, laying a solid foundation for my later entrepreneurship in the field of technological innovation.

In my spare time, I enjoy relaxing through reading, running, and off-road activities. Additionally, I am an amateur radio operator with the call sign BD4WUC. This hobby helps me maintain my interest and passion for communication technologies.
